Simulating Transport Equation
Implemented a python program to solve the first order 1-D wave equation (transport equation/advection equation) using the 4th order Rungeâ€“Kutta (RK4) and explicit Euler method with 2nd order spatial discretization and periodic boundary conditions for spatial discretization
